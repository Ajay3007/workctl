## ⚠️ Heads Up

- **P1 Task #52 — "Add Sub task"** is still **OPEN** and flagged high priority. This was created on Feb 16 and hasn't been started yet — worth prioritizing soon.
- **P1 Task #41 — "Task UI changes"** is in progress — looks like an ongoing effort from the UI overhaul.
- You have **5 tasks still in progress** (including #11 GUI Evolution, #26 Intelligence Layer build, #28 Insight command, #29 .bat creation, #24 stats enhancement) — consider closing out some of these carry-overs.

## 💡 TL;DR
You went from foundational intelligence features early in the week to a full-blown GUI polish sprint mid-week, capping it off with packaging work. The project has real momentum — zero stagnant tasks and a near-74 productivity score. The big remaining chunks are the GUI evolution epic, sub-task support, and distribution packaging.
